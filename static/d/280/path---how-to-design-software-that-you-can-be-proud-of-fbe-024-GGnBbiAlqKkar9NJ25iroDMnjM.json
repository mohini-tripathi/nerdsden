If your program needs to do ten tasks to attain business objectives, you can’t get rid of any to make your application simpler.</p>\n<p>Increase in the number of product features along with environmental complexities (CPU, Memory, Network, etc.) increases the number of states a software system can be in, exponentially.

In most cases, software components need to interact with each other in some non-linear fashion and complexity of the system increases more than linearly.</p>\n<p>This non-linear interaction among software components makes it difficult to communicate the idea among the stakeholders and the team members which leads to product flaws, cost overruns, and schedule delays.</p>\n<p>The difficulty of estimating and understanding the possible states of a program is the primary cause of the software system being unreliable. It makes it hard to handle and control all the edge cases.</p>\n<p>This level of complexity is almost impossible for a single human brain even to comprehend. It becomes even harder when individual components are intertwined because we cannot reason about them in isolation.</p>\n<h3>Accidental Complexity</h3>\n<p>It occurs because developers don’t tend to be good at their jobs.

I happened to write around 110 drafts of the current article before publishing this one. But while programming that doesn’t happen.</p>\n<p>The clean code looks like it was easy to write, when in fact it usually involves several drafts. We write the best way that comes in our head first, notice the complexity introduced, then “look for a better way” and refactor to remove those complexities. Then we keep on “looking for a better move” until we are unable to find one.</p>\n<p>It’s not just individual developers makes their lives miserable. Organizations help them in that too. When any project is nearing completion, there is always a mad rush to get new features added. The rush is mad indeed because it leads into a trap of added complexities. They tend to focus on how quickly they can write something, how easy is it to replace one developer with another. Considering just the familiarity with the tools used, not the simplicity or complexity of the code the new developer needs to handle.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Qualities Of A Good Software Design</h2>\n<p>Our goal in this article is to learn how to design and develop good software systems.

We will follow industry practices and stay buzzword compliant with the latest trends, while quietly spreading complexity throughout the systems.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8be886ee7de18142fc068d5184740207/0b17d/connected-software-universe.webp\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 776px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/webp;base64,UklGRk4AAABXRUJQVlA4IEIAAAAQAwCdASoUAA8APm0skkWkIqGYBABABsS0gAAt9I6YeAAA/v4yHlB44VD9YOw3o5efK2z5p7ZqMXUhBPYZ6xayAAA='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Connected Software Universe\"\n        title=\"Connected Software Universe\"\n        src=\"/static/8be886ee7de18142fc068d5184740207/0b17d/connected-software-universe.webp\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8be886ee7de18142fc068d5184740207/e7115/connected-software-universe.webp 200w,\n/static/8be886ee7de18142fc068d5184740207/c2f58/connected-software-universe.webp 400w,\n/static/8be886ee7de18142fc068d5184740207/0b17d/connected-software-universe.webp 776w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>A software system can be assumed to be a connected universe, and your program is a dot in that universe. Your goal is to write the code in a way that complexity flows for people upstream or downstream of your application.</p>\n<h3>1. Use Deep Inheritance</h3>\n<p>Inheritance advocates code re-use. You should make it your religion. Whenever a new feature request comes along, other developers might try re-using your code.\nThey will think, “All I got to do is simply grab this Class from the project and use it.”</p>\n<p>Little would they know the surprise that awaits them? They would need all the parent Classes as well. Once they start compiling, they will realize your program depends on another object. They need to import that whole object along with all of its parents.</p>\n<p>Deep level inheritance helps polluting many higher-level classes with methods and properties which are relevant to only a small number of subclasses. It starts showing its true colors especially when the operations deal with complex relationships between objects.</p>\n<p>So, wait and watch as the software grows.</p>\n<h3>2. Embrace Setters And Getters</h3>\n<p>Let me start with an anecdote.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In one of my freelance project, I found out that dozens of websites were using the header and navigation of the parent corporation’s main site. Their websites worked fine for the first 30 minutes after the deployment. Then (bam!) suddenly all of them went down.</p>\n<p>Later on, we realized that the culprit was a setter method hiding deep within the guts of the shared platform that these different sites were using. A piece of code that was scheduled to run every 30 minutes updated the underlying value that determined side headers and languages by calling this setter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the end of every constructor run, we are guaranteed to have an object in a valid state. Setter methods can help in ruining all of that. It’s impossible to check validity in setter methods because of hierarchies in the data; they are not atomic. They also undermine interfaces, because they can’t enforce an interface contract.</p>\n<p>The getter methods can be just as bad. Let me demonstrate a use case:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre class=\"language-java\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Accounts</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">private</span> List<span class=\"token generics function\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>Account<span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span> accounts<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">public</span> List <span class=\"token generics function\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>Account<span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span> getAccounts <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> accounts<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>OK, that seems reasonable. We should be able to print user account details.</p>\n<p>In Java or Javascript, returning reference type from a getter provides that reference to the caller, and now he can manipulate it in unexpected ways.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"java\"><pre class=\"language-java\"><code class=\"language-java\">Accounts allAcounts <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> AccountTracker<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">lookupAccounts</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"nerdsden\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nList<span class=\"token generics function\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>Account<span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span> accounts <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> allAccounts<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getAccounts</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Can I remove all the accounts?</span>\naccounts<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">remove</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"nerdsden\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Seems like I can</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Prints Empty Result</span>\nAccountTracker<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">lookupAccounts</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"nerdsden\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">printReport</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>That’s why getters and setters should be an integral component in your software design if you are aiming for complexity.</p>\n<p>There are few ways to mitigate such tragedies. You must stay away from any of these.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Return a copy instead of references</em></li>\n<li><em>Have immutable properties</em></li>\n<li><em>The best way is not to expose any member at all. Instead, manipulations of properties must happen inside the class. It helps in achieving full isolation of implementation and creates only one place to change.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>3.

Enqueue</h3>\n<p>Object-Oriented Programming facilitates method calls on objects - presumes that objects are available and close. Since that’s not always true, queues can come to your rescue.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to use queues:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Decoupling:</strong> It’s difficult to predict the state of the project in the future. Message queues provide separation of concerns among processes with a data-based interface to communicate among them. This way each service can be modified, scaled independently, by only adhering to the same interface.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Reliability:</strong> Sometimes jobs fail due to process failure. Queues provide us ways to store the information until it executes the tasks successfully.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Scalability:</strong> As message queues decouple your services, it’s easy to scale up the system to handle the more massive load just by adding new processes.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Debuggability:</strong> Queues give you an excellent insight into the data flow of the application. By measuring the rate of message processing, we can quickly identify the under-performing processes.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Resiliency:</strong> When some services in your application breaks, it shouldn’t take the whole system down with it.

Operations like <code class=\"language-text\">IF, ELSE, FOR LOOP, etc.</code> represent control flow. A program with more conditional logic is more difficult to understand, this metric gives us an assessment of that.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.projectcodemeter.com/cost_estimation/help/GL_halstead.htm\"><em><strong>Halstead volume:</strong></em></a> <em>It is a measurement of how much information exist in the source code. It looks at the number of variables, functions, operations, and frequency of their usage across the source code. A programmer must get himself familiar with this information as they all affect data flow within the running program.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.projectcodemeter.com/cost_estimation/help/GL_maintainability.htm\"><em><strong>Maintainability Index:</strong></em></a> <em>It tries to formulate the overall maintainability of the source code with an empirical formula.

We briefly try to answer the following set of questions in this step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>What’s our singular long-term vision?</em></li>\n<li><em>Why are we building this product ourselves?</em></li>\n<li><em>What problems are we trying to solve?</em></li>\n<li><em>How is it different from other similar products?</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just writing it down ends up influencing our further decisions and keeps us on a consistent path.</p>\n<h3>Narrate The User Experience</h3>\n<p>The target of this step is to tell the story from a user’s perspective. We decide to get into our user’s shoes, and build a story around an ideal user experience we hope to achieve.</p>\n<p>Softwares are for people, not the other way around. Therefore, discovering how people are going to use the software effectively is the key driving factor for building an efficient user experience. This step allows anecdotally showcasing our ideas and research.</p>\n<h3>Business Objectives</h3>\n<p>Once we narrate the stories about our vision and users experiences, defining business objectives helps us to crystallize a vague idea into concrete and clear goals we should focus. Template for writing this section is we need to answer the following three questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>What do we have to accomplish to be nearer to our vision?</em></li>\n<li><em>How are we going to get that done?</em></li>\n<li><em>What should we measure to define the success of our objective?</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To shape our problems and maintain the laser focus we enforce the following constraints among ourselves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Maximum of three business objectives are allowed for every quarter for every person.</em></li>\n<li><em>Every business objective must be achievable within 30 days of time along with 15 days release or feedback cycle.</em></li>\n<li><em>In an ideal situation, this would be achievable. But we don’t live in a perfect world. Therefore we keep one month spare to cover up our tracks in case we fucked up.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Map Business Objectives With Tech Objectives</h3>\n<p>For every business goals defined, we list down our engineering goals.</p>\n<h3>Tech Objectives</h3>\n<p>I am a big advocate of being a lazy but efficient developer. Whenever any new feature request comes to our engineering team, there has to be an excellent reason for that.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we further scrutinize and prioritize our engineering goals.</p>\n<p>After finalizing our technical objectives, we get on to discussing and writing about overall architecture.</p>\n<h3>Define Interfaces And Document Them</h3>\n<p>We start defining interfaces for every segment of customers we need to cater.\nThere are three customer segments for the engineering team:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Developers</strong> are responsible for building the product and ensuring it’s reliability, scalability, and performance.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Business Operators</strong> are the mediators between developers and users. They are responsible for understanding the requirements of users, align them with our business goals and help developers to understand the problem we need to solve.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Users</strong> are the people who will use the product.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Define Specifications And Constraints</h3>\n<p>After documenting the requirements and writing related interfaces, we write specifications for each of our interfaces.</p>\n<p>These specifications take the form of <em><strong>property-based tests</strong></em> in our development flow.</p>\n<p>To be more productive and come up with efficient solutions we constrain ourselves in three dimensions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Time:</strong> To provide a realistic estimate of development time, we follow the two-week development cycle. At the end of two weeks, we seek feedback from business operators and users.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Budget:</strong> The amount of money the product development should take.</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Maintainability Index:</strong> As we focus on writing maintainable and extendable code. Keeping a check on our maintainability index helps us to be creative while programming.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before diving into writing code these specifications and constraints are communicated to all the stakeholders.</p>\n<h3>Show Me The Code</h3>\n<p>Now we start implementing the interfaces to pass the property-based tests we wrote while declaring product specifications.</p>\n<h3>Demo Day</h3>\n<p>The last step is to demo the product. We usually create a video showcasing the product or library. Write articles about it and publish it at <a href=\"https://nerds-den.com\">Nerd’s Den</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Either you abandon the product early, or you stick with it long enough to see it become complex.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/10992a223b68dbadfc06df0b8fa69456/13df6/chaos-software-development.webp\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 540px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 76.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQBAABXRUJQVlA4IBgBAAAwBwCdASoUAA8APm0qkkWkIqGYBABABsS2AE6ZQjubwC3DtBGgMMB57emAc9v+wHwjkqq8dKBsK2q3Vs/HIIgSi0gA/vgopQPdkm3m+HPqvjCgcaVc2RoMYdSXdTXgLTMh1N8mG7kSmIofKdslN2sb0QfwB/DPq9P1YS4pjR0LtReMsZRg0RRc9+B4wCFw3ff2Oqf+6NBmoelJ9J1n/wskGfed9/VFfDb/7YOgLi53CSP21pXq6v+xgqIEJt46YCbQJtu2LmGM/6od9YrYw+1L+cRmZs9G2U/VF4CTBG55iInFTOSSa5ttiMYrpHQ359Q1b1jCS0NF4f9ctPDCmcMLrJzrNn+at88W9An/PZ46Vg1mL6DZAAAA'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Chaos In Software Development\"\n        title=\"Chaos In Software Development\"\n        src=\"/static/10992a223b68dbadfc06df0b8fa69456/13df6/chaos-software-development.webp\"\n        srcset=\"/static/10992a223b68dbadfc06df0b8fa69456/5aef1/chaos-software-development.webp 200w,\n/static/10992a223b68dbadfc06df0b8fa69456/25460/chaos-software-development.webp 400w,\n/static/10992a223b68dbadfc06df0b8fa69456/13df6/chaos-software-development.webp 540w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Any useful software program either evolves with time, or it becomes obsolete.
