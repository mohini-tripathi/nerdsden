Over three years, I worked as a Backend Team Lead at [Elanic](https://elanic.in) _(India's Biggest Community For Buying and Selling)_. I learned a lot about software development during these _"firey"_ years of scaling Elanic from thirty users in August 2015 to three million users in August 2018.

I started with no prior experience in building a production-grade software system. I thought I had a good foundation of programming concepts. How hard could it be? Little that I knew, I am in for lots of sleepless nights and burning myself out in the quest of stabilizing Elanic's backend system.Â

No other experience could have taught me what I know today. In this article, I share the software design lessons I learned the hard way.
